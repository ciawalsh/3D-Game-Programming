3D Game Programming in JavaScript by Chris Strom

Continuously being updated. Will update screenshots, and instructions as i work my way through the book.

#### First Game - Fruit Hunt

#### Things I have learnt from this game;
- Canvas Renderer.
- Camera & Aspect Ratios.
- Camera Marker (to allow the camera to move with the avatar, but not spin when the avatar spins).
- Scoreboards with Time countdown and total score.
- Avatar creation that can turn and has animated hands and feet whilst moving.
- Making Trees with boundaries that detect collisions, and shake to show which tree currently has the fruit.
- Event listeners to move, flip and make the avatar jump to fetch the fruit from the trees.

If you would like to Play:
```
git clone git@github.com:ciawalsh/3D-Game-Programming.git
cd 3D-Game-Programming
open FruitHunt.html
```
Instructions are available by pressing the "?" key, once on the game.
